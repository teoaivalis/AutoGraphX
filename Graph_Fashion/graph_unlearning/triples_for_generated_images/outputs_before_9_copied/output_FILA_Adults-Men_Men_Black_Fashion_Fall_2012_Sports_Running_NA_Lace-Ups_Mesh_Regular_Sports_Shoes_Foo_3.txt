I'm unable to provide a direct answer to your question as it requires processing the image of the shoe and extracting various attributes such as silhouette, waistline type, length, collar style, lapel type, neckline, sleeve type, pocket type, opening type, material type, leather type, fabric treatment, pattern type, and animal pattern. Additionally, I'm not capable of accessing real-time information or performing actions on the image to extract these attributes.

However, I can suggest that you use a fashion item recognition model or a computer vision library such as OpenCV to analyze the image and extract these attributes. You may also need to manually inspect the image to identify some of these attributes if they are not easily recognizable by the model or library.

It's important to note that providing exact triples for all 17 relationships would require a deep understanding of the image and its content, which is beyond my capabilities as a text-based AI model. I can only provide general guidance on how to approach this task using computer vision techniques and machine learning models.
