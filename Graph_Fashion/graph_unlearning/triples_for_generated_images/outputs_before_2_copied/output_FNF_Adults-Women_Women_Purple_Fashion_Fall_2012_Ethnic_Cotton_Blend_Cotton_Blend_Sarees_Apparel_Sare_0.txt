A triple is a three-element sequence used to represent information about clothing items or outfits. It consists of an image name, followed by a relationship label, and then the attribute value associated with that relationship.

Let's analyze the given image:

*   The image depicts a woman wearing a purple saree.
*   The saree is made from cotton blend fabric.
*   The saree has a traditional ethnic design.
*   The saree is suitable for fall 2012 fashion.
*   The saree has an appliqué pattern.

Based on this analysis, we can create the following triples:

1.  (FNF_Adults-Women_Women_Purple_Fashion_Fall_2012_Ethnic_Cotton_Blend_Cotton_Blend_Sarees_Apparel_Sare_0, depicts, Sari)
