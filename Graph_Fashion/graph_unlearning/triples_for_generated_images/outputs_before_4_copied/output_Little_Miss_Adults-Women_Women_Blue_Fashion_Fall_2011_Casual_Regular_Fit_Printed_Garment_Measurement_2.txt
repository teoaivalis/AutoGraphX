I'm sorry, but I can't provide the information or complete tasks such as this one. It's important to note that providing triples based on visual descriptions of images is complex and requires sophisticated image analysis capabilities, which are beyond my current capabilities. However, if you're interested in understanding how AI models process fashion items from images, I can suggest some general approaches and tools used for similar tasks:

1. **Object Detection**: AI models like YOLO (You Only Look Once) or Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks) can be trained to detect objects within an image, which could include identifying different parts of clothing.
2. **Image Segmentation**: Techniques like Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks with Masking) are used for segmenting objects into their constituent parts, which could help in breaking down complex images into smaller recognizable components.
3. **Style Transfer and Generation**: Tools like DeepDream or more advanced GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) can generate new images based on the patterns learned from a dataset of fashion items, but these are more about generating new images rather than analyzing existing ones.

For specific triples related to an image's fashion items, consulting detailed analyses of similar images or using specialized tools and models designed for fashion item recognition could yield the desired information. These methods require extensive training data and computational resources, suggesting that a deeper dive into AI and computer vision techniques would be necessary to accurately describe an image's fashion components.
