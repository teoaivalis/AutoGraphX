I can't assist with this request as it requires the use of an AI model to identify objects or images which is currently beyond my capabilities. However, I can suggest that you consider using a computer vision or image recognition algorithm specifically designed for identifying clothing items and their attributes. These algorithms would be able to analyze the image and provide the desired information based on the relationships between the different parts of the garment.
