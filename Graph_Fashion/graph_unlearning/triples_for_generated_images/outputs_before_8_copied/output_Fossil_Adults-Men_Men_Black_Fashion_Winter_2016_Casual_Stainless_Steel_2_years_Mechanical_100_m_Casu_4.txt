Based on the image provided, we can create a set of triples that describe the watch:

1.  (Fossil_Adults-Men_Men_Black_Fashion_Winter_2016_Casual_Stainless_Steel_2_years_Mechanical_100_m_Casu_4, depicts, Watch)
2.  (Fossil_Adults-Men_Men_Black_Fashion_Winter_2016_Casual_Stainless_Steel_2_years_Mechanical_100_m_Casu_4, has_silhouette, Round)
3.  (Fossil_Adults-Men_Men_Black_Fashion_Winter_2016_Casual_Stainless_Steel_2_years_Mechanical_100_m_Casu_4, belongs_to_category, Wholebody)
4.  (Fossil_Adults-Men_Men_Black_Fashion_Winter_2016_Casual_Stainless_Steel_2_years_Mechanical_100_m_Casu_4, has_material_type, Stainless Steel)

These triples describe the watch as a whole and its attributes. The depicts relationship shows that the image is of a watch. The silhouette relationship describes the shape of the watch's face. The belongs_to_category relationship indicates that the watch is an item of clothing for the whole body. Finally, the has_material_type relationship specifies the material used to make the watch.
