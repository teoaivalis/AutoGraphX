Based on the image of a black formal shoe, here are the triples for the relationships that describe the image:

1. **image_name**, **depicts**, **Shoe**
2. **image_name**, **belongs_to_category**, **Wholebody**
3. **image_name**, **has_silhouette**, **Pointed Toe**
4. **image_name**, **has_waistline**, **None**
5. **image_name**, **has_length**, **Short**
6. **image_name**, **has_collar_type**, **None**
7. **image_name**, **has_lapel_type**, **None**
8. **image_name**, **has_neckline**, **None**
9. **image_name**, **has_sleeve_type**, **None**
10. **image_name**, **has_pocket_type**, **None**
11. **image_name**, **has_opening_type**, **Lace-Up**
12. **image_name**, **has_material_type**, **Leather**
13. **image_name**, **has_leather_type**, **Full Grain Leather**
14. **image_name**, **has_fabric_treatment**, **None**
15. **image_name**, **has_pattern**, **Solid Color**

Note that some of the relationships have no attribute value (e.g., **has_waistline**), which means that the shoe does not have a waistline or it is not applicable in this context. Similarly, some attributes have a value of "None" because they are not relevant to the shoe's design.
