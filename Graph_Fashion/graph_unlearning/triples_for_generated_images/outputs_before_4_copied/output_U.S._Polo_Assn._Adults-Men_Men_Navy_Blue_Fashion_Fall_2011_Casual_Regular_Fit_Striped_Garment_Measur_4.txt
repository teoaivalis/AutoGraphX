**Answer:**

To derive the solution, we need to analyze the image of a man wearing a striped shirt. Based on the image, here are the triples that describe the relationships between the fashion item and its attributes:

*   (U.S._Polo_Assn._Adults-Men_Men_Navy_Blue_Fashion_Fall_2011_Casual_Regular_Fit_Striped_Garment_Measur_4, depicts, Shirt)
*   (U.S._Polo_Assn._Adults-Men_Men_Navy_Blue_Fashion_Fall_2011_Casual_Regular_Fit_Striped_Garment_Measur_4, belongs_to_category, upperbody)
*   (U.S._Polo_Assn._Adults-Men_Men_Navy_Blue_Fashion_Fall_2011_Casual_Regular_Fit_Striped_Garment_Measur_4, has_silhouette, Regular fit)
*   (U.S._Polo_Assn._Adults-Men_Men_Navy_Blue_Fashion_Fall_2011_Casual_Regular_Fit_Striped_Garment_Measur_4, has_length, Short sleeve)

These triples describe the fashion item as a shirt that belongs to the upperbody category, has a regular fit silhouette, and short sleeves.
